Add your answers to the Algorithms exercises here.
Exercise I:
a. O(n)
b. O(log n)
c. O(Sqrt)
d. O(n log n)
e. O(n^3)
f. O(n)
g. O(1)

Exercise II
a. def findMaxValue(arr):
  for a in arr:
    maxV = arr[0]
    if arr[0] > arr[i]:
      max = arr[0]
  return max 

b. Start from the bottom floor and find the first floor where the egg breaks and that floor is the optimal place to stop
def eggdrop(n):
  n = 0
  if eggdrop and not broken:
    increment + 1
  else:
    return n where eggdrop and broken.

Exercise III:
a. O(1) since it is the first element, it is retriving the first element.
b. O(log n), since it median, need only check half of the array
